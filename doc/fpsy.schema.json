  "description": "Camera parameters exported by the fSpy application\n\n> Camera matching, or camera calibration, is the process of estimating camera parameters from certain features in an image. fSpy computes the approximate focal length, orientation and position of the camera in 3D space based on user defined control points in still images. The computed camera parameters can be used in other apps, for example 3D modeling tools.\n\nRead more at https://fspy.io/basics/.",
